# **Project Summary:**
We'll use amazon's data for our project. You can either download data directly from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/karkavelrajaj/amazon-sales-dataset), or  you can donwload using Kaggle's API.

![ConvAI using LLMs ](https://github.com/Praveen76/Recommender-System-and-ConvAI-using-LLMs-on-e-commerce-Data/blob/main/Conversational%20AI.webp)

The idea of the project is to build a Hybrid Recommender System using Cosine and Jaccard Similarities methods.

# Recommender System using cosine and jaccard similarity:
  * Product Clustering: We'll use product_id, Discounted_Price, Subcategory, rating to find products similarity.
  * User clustering: Calculate users similarity using jaccard similarity with input features such as user_id, product_id, Subcategory, rating.
